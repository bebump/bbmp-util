## nvapi

This is a wrapper around NVIDIA's nvapi for querying the temperature of the GPU. The license of 
nvapi does not allow me to redistribute it, so **you have to download the SDK from NVIDIA's website,
then move contents into the appropriate subdirectories yourself**. The `nvapi/.gitignore` file will
show you what goes where.
